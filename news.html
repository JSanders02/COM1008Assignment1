                <p>On the 78th of Febtober, 2021, Lambton Entertainment was
                    officially founded at Penshaw Monument, in the historic
                    County Durham. The company was founded a week after two
                    of our founders returned from their fateful Madagascar
                    trip.<br><br> Jack and Julie met with Terrence to discuss
                    their plans for the company, and at that exact moment, they
                    spotted a bizarre-nosed chameleon, that was coincidentally
                    vacationing in the area. They knew this must have been fate!
                    Jack whipped out his phone and, using what little mobile
                    signal he had, immediately registered the company, and our
                    journey begun.</p>

                <h3>Our Name: Where did it Come From?</h3>
                <figure class="news-article-image">

                <p>Our company name was decided on the day that the company
                    was founded. Since we were founded at Penshaw Monument,
                    Jack decided that our name should be related to it, and
                    so it was decided that it would come from an old folk
                    tale surrounding the hill upon which the monument sits,
                    namely that of the Lambton Worm. <br><br>The story is about
                    a worm (think of a very very large snake, with huge teeth,
                    and great beady eyes), that was caught by John Lambton while
                    he was fishing, before he promptly threw it into a nearby
                    well. While it was initially relatively small, it soon grew
                    larger, and started feeding off of cattle from the
                    surrounding farms (and even some children!). While Lambton
                    was away fighting with the Crusades, the worm left its well,
                    and coiled itself seven times around Penshaw Hill, until
                    John Lambton returned, and slew the beast!<br>

                <p>Shock horror at Lambton Entertainment HQ, as hungry staff
                    woke up from their designated cells to find that their
                    breakfast, the most important meal of the day, was
                    RUINED. Designated toastmaster and toast maker Terrence
                    placed the bread into the industrial sized Toastermatic
                    3000&trade;, before his mind wandered and the toast-to-be
                    was soon forgotten about. When it was finally
                    discovered, a hard black crust of ash had formed over
                    the surface of the bread, rendering it utterly inedible.

                <p>It was a strange day at the office yesterday for Lambton
                    Entertainment's HR Department, who had to deal with a quite
                    peculiar request. At 11:06AM GMT, a small lizard walked
                    into the building, and after introducing himself as a
                    <q>perfectly-normal-nosed Chameleon, thank you very
                        much!</q> was directed to the HR department, whom he
                    asked - very politely - if they could stop referring to
                    him as <q>bizarre-nosed</q>. He claimed the term was
                    negatively impacting his Self-esteem, and so, after much
                    deliberation, Lambton Entertainment has agreed with the
                    lizard to not refer to his nose in future, and hopes the
                    wider scientific community will do the same.<br><br>
                    <q class="fancy-quote">Honestly, I'm just glad we had the
                        whole thing sorted so quickly!</q> - The Regular-Nosed

                <h3>The Tale of Boris - The Dog who Helped Found This
                    Company</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>Boris is a Frisian Stabij, and he was adopted by our
                    founders at the young age of 37.5. Before being adopted,
                    he embarked on his own voyage to Madagascar, with the
                    intention of acquiring a bone that he dropped there many
                    years ago. However, he ended up making friends for life
                    when he met our founders, who were staying in the same
                    hotel as him for the duration of both their trips. At
                    the end of the trip, Jack and Julie took him home,
                    alongside a Greggs sausage roll (leftover from the day
                    before's lunch). On the return journey, Boris discovered
                    his passion for swimming (as pictured), and currently
                    holds the world record for fastest 100m doggypaddle, at
                    an incredible 4 minutes and 45.356 seconds! Boris was
                    instrumental in the creation of the company, as he was
                    kind enough to model for some of the photos in our game!
                    Without him, this company would not have been possible.
