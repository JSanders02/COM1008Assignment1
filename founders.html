            <p class="founder-desc"> Jack Sanders founded Lambton Entertainment
                in 2021, with a clear vision to provide the best games for young
                children, to help them learn about the world and creatures in
                it. He was inspired to do this after a long trip to the baobab
                trees of Madagascar, in which he would witness a small child
                refer to a bizarre-nosed chameleon as a 'gecko'. This heinous
                misidentification set him on a course to change the lives of
                tens of young kids around the globe. Now, kids will be able to
                easily tell their mountain chickens from their appenzell pointed
                hood hens, and most importantly, have fun while doing so!</p>

            <p class="founder-desc"> Julie Parkins met Jack Sanders on that
                fateful Madagascar odyssey, where he shared with her the
                tale of the harrowing events of the day before. With just
                a Greggs Sausage Roll, two Lucozades, and a pet dog, they set
                off on a journey greater than the Hobbit. Through many sleepless
                siestas, they built an empire of childrens' games, founded on
                the basis that no critically endangered species should ever be
                misidentified again.</p>

            <p class="founder-desc"> Terrence Walters-Toasters is an old
                friend of Jack Sanders,who he met at the world-renowned
                ToasterCon in 2007, in London - although, Terrence doesn't
                actually like toasters, he was just there because he thought it
                was a family gathering. They bonded over a mutual love of
                identifying various objects/animals, and so he was recruited
                into Lambton Entertainment as toastmaster-in-chief in
                December of 2021, due to his excellent public speaking skills
                and incredibly apt surname.
